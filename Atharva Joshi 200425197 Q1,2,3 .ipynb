Here foldSize is the step size for the 'for loop'. The 'for loop' begins with the assigning of test data. In the first iteration the test data will be from the first record to the record at foldSize position. eg. Assume there are 100 records with 10 folds. foldSize will be 100/10=10. Hence, the test data will be from 0 to 9. Remaining will be the training data. Using this training data we train the classifier. We then use that classifier to predict labels for the test data extracted. We already have the actual labels in the second column of the test data. We extract them and compare that with the predicted lables to get Precision, Recall, FScore and Accuracy. We then continue the loop considering the second fold i.e 10 to 19 as the testing data and remaining (0 to 9 and 20 to 99) as the training data. The same process continues till the classifier is trained using the remaining data (0 to 89) and tested using the last fold i.e. 90 to 99 . Lastly we print the average accuracy of all 10 folds."
